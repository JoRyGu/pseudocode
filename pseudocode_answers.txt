Short Answer
  1. Why do programmers use pseudocode?
    - Programmers use pseudocode in order to brainstorm how you're going to
      solve a problem before you start writing code in the language of your choice.
      It also allows programmers to share this information with others who may
      not have an undertanding of the language that programmer is using.

  2. If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?
    - Probably nothing, or it would just throw errors if anything. Pseudocode is
      not a language that is meant to be understood by computers. It's only 
      able to be read by humans.

Programming Assignment
  1. Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.

  INPUT 2 numbers, A and B
    IF A is GREATER THAN B THEN
      PRINT A to the console
    ELSE
      PRINT B to the console

  2. Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100

  INIT counter to 1
  WHILE the counter is LESS THAN or EQUAL TO 100
    PRINT the counter
    ADD 1 to counter
  END WHILE

  3. Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook

  INPUT search term, SEARCH_ENTRY
    FOR an iterator INIT to 0, WHILE iterator is LESS THAN the length of PHONEBOOK, ADD 1 to iterator after each LOOP
      IF the term at the iterator'th INDEX in the phonebook matches SEARCH_ENTRY THEN
        RETURN the INDEX
      ELSE
        CONTINUE searching
    END FOR
    RETURN -1

  4. Javascript implementation:

  function searchPhonebook(searchEntry) {
    for(let i = 0; i < phonebook.length; i++) {
      if(phonebook[i] === searchEntry) {
        return i;
      }
    }
    return -1;
  }
